## Getting started

First, you have to install all the necessary packages:

```bash
npm i
```

Once that is done, you have to start the server:
```bash
npm run dev:server
```

and then the frontend application:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Don't close the terminal windows, the application works only if both of these are actively running.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Check your briefing and download the correct branch
Depending on which task you chose to focus on, check the task briefing in [Jira](https://frivilligfredag23.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/FF/boards/1).
You can either download the code files from the links given in the briefings, or if you feel confident in Git, feel free to checkout the different branches.

Please ask questions if you're unsure or get stuck :)

### *Happy coding!*
